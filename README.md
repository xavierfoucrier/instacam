Compatibility
-------------
Instacam is fully tested on **Google Chrome** for desktop *(latest public released version)*, on a **Google Nexus 7** tablet and on a **Google Nexus 5** phone. Both Android devices are running `Android "Lollipop" 5.1`. The plugin is compatible with browser that natively support the HTML5 `canvas` tag, `requestAnimationFrame` API and `getUserMedia` API. The CSS filtering requires the `CSS filter` features to properly work.

Official support on Chrome 36+, Firefox 31+, and Opera 23+. Many other browsers may work, but are not extensively tested. You can check at any time the [support table](http://caniuse.com/) about the partial or full support of these features.


Dependencies
------------
To ensure a stable running of Instacam, you need to have **some requirements** setted on your website.

1. Javascript library `jQuery 1.3` minimum required, tested on 1.11+ and working fine with 2.0+
3. HTML5 doctype, not required, but better for a good W3C validation

Note that jQuery 2.0 or higher doesn't support IE 6/7/8 anymore.
