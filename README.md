[![Instacam](logo.png "Instacam")](https://instacam.js.org)


## Compatibility
Instacam is fully tested on **Google Chrome** for desktop *(latest public released version)*. The plugin is compatible with browsers that natively support the HTML5 `canvas` tag, `requestAnimationFrame` API, `HTMLMediaElement` API, `navigator.mediaDevices` and `Promises` API. The CSS filtering requires the `CSS filter` features to properly work.

Official support on **Chrome 52+, Firefox 52+, Edge 15+ and Opera 52+**. Many other browsers may work, but are not extensively tested. You can check at any time the [support table](https://caniuse.com) about the partial or full support of these features.


## Install
Instacam is published on the **NPM** *(Node Package Manager)* registry, so you can install it through the command line interpreter using your favorite package manager:

```console
# npm
npm install instacam

# yarn
yarn add instacam
```
